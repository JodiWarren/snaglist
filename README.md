# Snaglist for Meteor

Snaglist is a to-do list application written for Meteor.

**Please note, this is a very incomplete pre-alpha version.**

It's currently very feature-incomplete, but the target is:

- Easily add, edit, delete and re-order snags
- Manage multiple lists
- Lists can be public or private
- Per-snag private or public editability

Meteor also gives us neat multi-user collaboration by default.

I'm using this to learn how to use Meteor, and how to build and design web apps in general.
